functional interface: 

java.util.function package 

@Functional Interface
public interface{
void();
}

In selenium like Webdriver is Interface   we use chrome, safari,firefox.etc but we wanto to 
add any fuctional on interface so we can go for @Functional Interface annotations.
This functional interface is single abstract method or single interface method.so i create 
interface class and create one void method and implements the methods in all browser.

Ex.function input recevied and give a certain operation perfomed whatever  any output return type
one input value accepted and given any certain value is given  is functional interface 

predicate: 

and its mild different any operation is going to conditional operation of boolean value  return type is predicate. reason is abstract method is call Test return is boolean value.


any type input value accepted and done any operation  given boolean value is given  is predicate interface . method  -> test


consumer:

any type input value accepted and done any operation  but dont want given any output is consumer. methods--> accept,and,then



supplier: no any input are given and retrieving and return the value.methods --> get()



















supplier: 

supplier is opposite to consumer
